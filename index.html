        <h2>Wyoming</h2>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eeCpF12V10Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>I was listening to this cover when my mom almost got attacked by a bear in Wyoming. Her voice is so somber and it's really sad how the song describes her in a way, but somehow the song is also comforting.</p>

        <p>I was clearly a bit obsessed with covers during my trip to Wyoming &#40;I also was listening to Taylor's cover of Riptide religiously&#41;. This cover never fails to bring a smile to my face. My mom is definetly sick of me blasting it, but I don't care.</p>

        <h2>France</h2>
        <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="150" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/wiggle-feat-snoop-dogg/840381885?i=840381891"></iframe>
        <p>Before I start let me just say that French radio is quite unique. The music is always a few years old and they play some special songs. One year they would constantly play this song and since I was probably six or something like that my parents would always switch the channel, but we'd still hear the wiggle wiggle wiggle at the beginning hehe. </p>
        <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="150" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/sun-is-shining/1440906983?i=1440907562"></iframe>
        <p>This is another song they would constantly play on the radio. My mom joked one day that it would be a great song to wake up my sister with, so ever since then I have woken her up by storming into her room, opening up the blinds, and blasting this song. On a seperate note, I do not understand why people would voluntarily sleep with their blinds open. I mean I get it if you have neighbors close by or you are on the first floor, but why else would you do it&#63;</p>

        <p>I think I have told you about this, but I have some very distinct memories of playing Lover, the album, in France. I remember listening to this while sitting on a stone wall that was on the edge of a cliff after dinner. That was probably the worst day of my life, bit in that moment everything felt okay.</p>
        <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="150" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/paper-rings/1468058165?i=1468058181"></iframe>
        <p>This story is similar, but it was the day Lover was released. I was playing this for my family in the car while we were driving back from dinner.</p>
        <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="150" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/rain/1476460390?i=1476460391"></iframe>
        <p>This was the right before Lover was released and I was playing this song while walking home from dinner. WHY ARE ALL THESE MEMORIES FROM RIGHT AFTER DINNER&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;</p>

        <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="150" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/heaven-feat-betty-who/1389111732?i=1389112011"></iframe>
        <p>I would listen to this song while biking on the bike path, and just contemplate life. </p>
        <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="150" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/christmas-tree-farm/1490369893?i=1490369895"></iframe>
        <p>Of course I listen to this while dancing around my Christmas tree farm.</p>
        <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="150" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/sweet-but-psycho/1538214602?i=1538214889"></iframe>
        <p>This song was constantly playing on the radio when my dad and I would drive back from skiing.</p>
        <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="150" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/thank-u-next/1450330588?i=1450330686"></iframe>
        <p>Another car radio song. My mom thought the lyrics were &quot;Bacon, eggs&quot;.</p>
        <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="150" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/boys-will-be-bugs/1553605542?i=1553605544"></iframe>
        <p>I would listen to this song while skateboarding in my driveway. No, I cannot skateboard.</p>
        <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="150" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/this-is-me-trying/1524801260?i=1524801960"></iframe>
        <p>Another skateboard song. I was always mesmerized by the lyrics, &quot;You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town.&quot; I won't make it its own thing because I've done enough skateboarding songs but I'd also listen to the lakes. It wasn't out yet at that point, but I downloaded it from reddit.</p>

        <h2>Bahamas</h2>
        <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="150" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/if-we-make-it-through-december/1540377731?i=1540377732"></iframe>
        <p>The last time I was in the Bahamas for Christmas I would blast this song on my daily morning beach strolls.</p>

        <p>The owner of my camp made this the song of the year once and it was soooo annoying, but he loved it.</p>
        <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="150" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/riptide/1022164257?i=1022164261"></iframe>

        <p>We would change the lyrics to songs and sing them at cove. This was the most iconic one.</p>
